Assuming you have node and npm properly installed on the machine, I would

Download the code
Navigate to inside the project folder on terminal, where I would hopefully see a package.json file
Do an npm install for installing all the project dependencies
Do an npm install -g nodemon for installing all the project dependencies
Then npm start OR node app.js OR nodemon app.js to get the app running on local host
